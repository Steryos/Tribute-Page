        <h3><i>A timeline of Thomas Sankara's lifelong events</i></h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1949</b> - Born in Yako, French Upper Volta as the third of ten children to Joseph and Marguerite Sankara.</li>
          <li><b>1966</b> - His Roman Catholic parents wanted him to become a priest, but he entered the military academy of Kadiogo in Ouagadougou, at the age of 17.</li>
          <li><b>1970</b> - At the age of 20, Sankara went on for further military studies at the military academy of Antsirabe in Madagascar.</li>
          <li><b>1974</b> - Fought in a border war between Upper Volta and Mali and earned fame for his heroic performance. Years later would renounce the war as "useless and unjust".</li>
          <li><b>1976</b> - Became commander of the Commando Training Centre in Pô.</li>
          <li><b>1981</b> - Sankara was appointed Minister of Information in September and differentiated himself from other government officials in many ways. While his predecessors would censor journalists and newspapers, he encouraged investigative journalism.</li>
          <li><b>1983</b> - After another coup in November 1982 brought to power Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, Sankara became Prime Minister in January but was dismissed and later arrested. With the blessings of Libya, his imprisonment created enough momentum for his friend Blaise Compaoré to lead another coup, which made Sankara President at the age of 33.</li>
          <li><b>1984</b> - On the first anniversary of his accession, he renamed the country Burkina Faso, meaning "the land of upright people" in Moré and Dyula the two major languages of the country. He gave it a new flag, wrote a new national anthem and was the first African leader to appoint women to major cabinet positions.</li>
          <li><b>1987</b> - He was assassinated by an armed group with twelve other officials in a coup d'état, organized by his former colleague Blaise Compaoré, four years after the people lifted him up as the president of their new revolutionary nation-state.</li>
